The chair assembly process consists of 9 steps:

1_pickupbolt: Pick up 4 bolts from a box
2_placeparts: Place the base plate onto the seat cushion
3_placebolts: Place 4 bolts onto the base plate
4_hexwrench_light: Lightly screw the bolts using a hex wrench
5_hexwrench_tight: Firmly tighten the bolts using a hex wrench
6_attachcylinder: Attach a cylinder to the base plate
7_moveseat: Move the cushion with the base plate into the position for leg attachment
8_attachleg: Attach a leg on the top of the cylinder
9_finishedchair: Move the assembled chair

## Your task
Your task is to classify the images provided later and determine whether they fall under Step 8: 8_attachleg.

You were given images that were examples of the chair assembly process.  
All the images except the last image, are the samples that belong to step 8_attachleg.
## sample1 — sample4 : A series of frames where a person is fitting the five-star leg base onto the gas-lift cylinder protruding from the seat cushion.

For your reference, the last image is the sample image that belongs to step 9_finishedchair.
## sample5 : A person carries the completed seat — now fitted with the star base — away from the table.
