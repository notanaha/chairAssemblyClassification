The chair assembly process consists of 9 steps:

1_pickupbolt: Pick up 4 bolts from a box
2_placeparts: Place the base plate onto the seat cushion
3_placebolts: Place 4 bolts onto the base plate
4_hexwrench_light: Lightly screw the bolts using a hex wrench
5_hexwrench_tight: Firmly tighten the bolts using a hex wrench
6_attachcylinder: Attach a cylinder to the base plate
7_moveseat: Move the cushion with the base plate into the position for leg attachment
8_attachleg: Attach a leg on the top of the cylinder
9_finishedchair: Move the assembled chair

## Your task
Your task is to classify the images provided later and determine whether they fall under Step 2: 2_placeparts.

You were given images that were examples of the chair assembly process.  
All the images, except the last image are the samples that belong to step 2_placeparts.
## sample1 — sample3 : A series of frames where a person is holding and placing the base plate onto the seat cushion.
In sample1, I drew a red boundary box for you to highlight the base plate.
In sample2, I drew a red and blue boundary box for you. Red boundary box highlights the base plate, and the blue boundary box highlights the seat cushion.
Since the frames are one second apart, the test frames provided later may miss some images that show the actual handling of the base plate as it is being placed on the seat cushion.
Consider whether the missing frames could bridge the two frames you were given.

For your reference, the last image is the sample image that belongs to step 3_placebolts.
## sample4 : A persopn is loosely placing the bolts into the base plate holes to stage them before tightening.

Note:
The short pillar, smaller than a person’s palm and positioned vertically to the base plate, is not a gas cylinder.
