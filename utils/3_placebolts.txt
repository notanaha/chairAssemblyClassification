The chair assembly process consists of 9 steps:

1_pickupbolt: Pick up 4 bolts from a box
2_placeparts: Place the base plate onto the seat cushion
3_placebolts: Place 4 bolts onto the base plate
4_hexwrench_light: Lightly screw the bolts using a hex wrench
5_hexwrench_tight: Firmly tighten the bolts using a hex wrench
6_attachcylinder: Attach a cylinder to the base plate
7_moveseat: Move the cushion with the base plate into the position for leg attachment
8_attachleg: Attach a leg on the top of the cylinder
9_finishedchair: Move the assembled chair

## Your task
Your task is to classify the images provided later and determine whether they fall under Step 3: 3_placebolts.

You were given images that were examples of the chair assembly process.  
The first five images are samples that belong to 3_placebolts.
## sample1 — sample5 : A series of frames where a persopn is loosely placing the bolts on the base plate to stage them before tightening.
In sample2, I drew a red circle to highlight a person’s hands positioned above the seat cushion, which I marked with a blue bounding box.
In the previous step, the person picked up several bolts and is holding them in his palm. This frame shows him picking up a bolt before loosely placing it on the base plate.
In Sample3, I drew a red circle focusing on the persons hands. With the both hands, the persopn is loosely placing the bolts on the base plate.

For your reference, I picked up two images that don't belong to 3_placebolts.
## sample6 : The sample image that belongs to step 4_hexwrench_light. A person lightly screws the bolts using a hex wrench, holding the long arm of the hex wrench with both hands applying gentle, controlled clockwise twists to lightly thread (or pause) the bolt without pressing on the cushion. In this step, both hands stay on the wrench shaft.
## sample7 : The sample image that belongs to step 5_hexwrench_tight. A person firmly tighten the bolts using a hex wrench. One hand wraps around the long end of the hex wrench and turns it in a firm clockwise twist to tighten the bolt. Simultaneously, another hand is on the cushion beside the bolt.

Note:
In many cases, a hex wrench as well as bolts is hidden in a person's hand and not visible. 
Conclude that the given images are classified as the step "3_placebolts" only the following statement is true.
- In one of the frames, the person is shown picking up bolts from his palm.
- In another frame, the person is loosely placing the bolts onto the base plate.
